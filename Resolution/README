Photolithography Optimization Solver Program.

This C++ Project contains a set of solving algorithms for the scheduling problem with unrelated parallel machines, auxiliary resources and sequence-dependent setup times. Three objective functions are dealt with:

1. Maximizing number of wafers before a given horizon
2. Minimizing the weighted sum of completion times
3. Minimizing the number of auxiliary resources moves.

A multi-objective version of the problem (minimizing Chebychev weighted sum of the criteria) is also handled.

This document describes the features of this module, and the way to use it.

Install Process

------------------------------------

You will need: 
	SCIP, version 3.0.0, linked with
	Zimpl, version 3.3.0 and an LP solver, such as
	SoPlex (version 2.0.0).
	
	GraphViz for the visualization of the schedule (neato module is necessary)
	
	typing "make" should be sufficient to generate the binary, which is located in the "bin" directory
